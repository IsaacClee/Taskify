                <h4>Desmond's Study at Cold Spring New York</h4>
                <h4>October 25th, 2020</h4>
                <p>It was a nearly 2am, and Desmond was thinking of calling it quits. </p>
                <p>Exocism had finally dried up, no more money in it anymore. </p>
                <p>Desmond had always figured it as an easy scam that couldn't really hurt anyone.</p>
                <p>...But, now nobody belived in this stuff...not even himself. </p>
                <p>Desmond was about to fall alseep when he heard a sinister whisper from outside.</p>
                <p>He grabbed his old-fashioned pistol and pointed at his front door.</p>
                <p>"Who goes there?!?" he shouted.</p>
                <p>The door started to shake on its hinges, stressing under the force from outsite.</p>
                <p>...Maybe it was just a burgler?</p>
                <br>
                <p>Then again, he could be on the radar of...other things</p>
                <p>Desmond grabbed a flask from his desk.</p>
                <p>"Good thing holy water is cheap these days", he thought to himself.</p>

                <h4>Saint Bernard's Cathedral at Cold Spring New York</h4>
                <h4>November 13th, 2020</h4>
                <p>Desmond arrived at Staint Bernard's shortly before Midnight.</p>
                <p>Since the first attack, Desmond was looking for explainations.</p>
                <p>After two weeks of digging, Desmond found a contact.</p>
                <p>Father Samuel said he knew about the person behind his..."visitation".</p>
                <br>
                <p>12:15am and Desmond knew something was off.</p>
                <p>No sign of the pastor and something occured on him.</p>
                <p>He hadn't bothered to check if the contact was legit.</p>
                <p>Desmond pulled out his phone and started a google search.</p>
                <p>The page loaded."Did you mean:..", Desmond read before he saw his company.</p>
                <p>A black hooded figure stepped out of the shadows with a baseball bat.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Man or Monster, which was worst? Desmond reached for his gun.</p>

                <h4>Califer's Forest, 30 miles from Cold Spring New York</h4>
                <h4>December 1st, 2020</h4>
                <p>3am and Desmond was freezing.</p>
                <p>He knew the Cult's "Housekeeper" was going to be somewhere out here.</p>
                <p>Desmond checked his notes once more and confirmed the date.</p>
                <p>Then he took a long look at the old cabin.</p>
                <p>"Pefect place to get murdered", he muttered to himself.</p>
                <p>He pushed on the cabin door and it creaked open.</p>
                <br>
                <p>It was empty. Completley empty. Desmond sighed with relief.</p>
                <p>Maybe it was a myth to keep the cult in line.</p>
                <p>He stepped outside and started to walk back toward his car.</p>
                <br>
                <p>On the road a ahead, a stranger stood. Facing away.</p>
                <p>"About time", growled he stranger.</p>
                <p>"Time to end this", Desmond whispered.</p>
